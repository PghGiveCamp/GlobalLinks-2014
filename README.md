================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PghGiveCamp/GlobalLinks-2014.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PghGiveCamp/GlobalLinks-2014)

## local development

There are two web servers.  One for frontend development, and one
for serving the sinatra app.  The sinatra app is served via the
`./server` executable, which is the same executable used on heroku.


``` bash
# run the thing locally
./server
```
